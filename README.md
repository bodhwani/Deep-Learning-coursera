Most of the basics are covered in <a href="https://github.com/bodhwani/Machine-Learning">Machine Learning Repository</a>
In this repo, lets discuss about neural network and deep learning.

#### I mainly focused on WHY for each concept. You can find and learn concepts through Google, but no one explains WHY. So here, I tried to mentioned what is the logic behind and WHY we are using that (as taught by Andrew Ng).

### Supervised Learning
Different neural networks are used for different applications
- For real state and online advertising,  we use standard neural network 
- For image, we use CNN
- For sequence data, for eg, audio, is we often use RNN. Languages are also represented as sequence data.
- For autonomous driving, we use complex or hybrid neural network


**Structured data :**
Features have well defined meaning

**Unstructured data :**
Example can be, audio, image or text. Here features can be pixels in images, or words in text. 
<br>
Here comes Deep Learning concepts. Computers are able to determine features of unstructured data more easily.

### Why deep learning?

> Use ReLu function instead of Sigmoid function, as learning rate changes very slowly in Sigmoid function, where slope becomes zero. This is not the case with ReLu function.
